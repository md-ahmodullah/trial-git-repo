hello, it's me ahmodullah. Adding a file without any reason. Just for practicing git branching nd merging.

I've done git pull and bring it into my local computer. Now, it's push it again on gtithub to save this para.

I have created a new branch named "dev" using "git branch dev" command.
And switched into it using "git checkout dev" command.

Now, I am in dev branch and these changes will save and add and commit to git. Then I will push the code to see what's happende actuallly.


The last time, I was created a branch using git bash. Now, I have created a branch using Github Graphical User Interface(GUI). This para will represent the new branch name "devGUI" and these line of text will added. I will commit this here and After that I will merge it with master branch. That's it.

Now, we are branching and merging locally. First, I make this changes and next i will add and commit it. Then I will merge it. After that, We will pull the changes in local computer then push it into github.

Practice again to become more clear and understand the concept more clearly.
